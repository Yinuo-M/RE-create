# About
This is a React app that introduces users to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's public collection. It displays a random exhibit from the collection upon every page refresh. Users can save their favourite exhibits in the app and revisit them.

This app uses the Met's public API, for more information about the API please visit https://metmuseum.github.io
